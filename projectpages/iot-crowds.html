	<!-- <p> our methodology employs crowdsourced, free-response -->
	<!--   expression labeling of images of our 3D avatar followed by -->
	<!--   natural language processing techniques to determine -->
	<!--   synonymous responses. </p> -->
	
	<p> Facial expression mapping is the process
	  of attributing signal values to a particular set of muscle
	  activations in the face. This paper proposes the development
	  of a broad lexicon of quantifiable, reproducible facial
	  expressions with known signal values using an expressive 3D
	  model and crowdsourced labeling data.  Traditionally, coding
	  muscle movements in the face is a time-consuming manual
	  process performed by specialists. Identifying the
	  communicative content of an expression generally requires
	  generating large sets of posed photographs, with identifying
	  labels chosen from a circumscribed list. Consequently, the
	  widely accepted collection of configurations with known
	  meanings is limited to six basic expressions of emotion. Our
	  approach defines mappings from parameterized facial
	  expressions displayed by a 3D avatar to their semantic
	  representations. By collecting large, free-response label
	  sets from naïve raters and using natural language processing
	  techniques, we converge on a semantic centroid, or single
	  label quickly and with low overhead. </p>

        <!-- <p> In this project, we develop an approach to identify privacy -->
	<!--   norms based on crowd responses to a series of multiple -->
	<!--   choice questions that reflect their expected privacy -->
	<!--   preferences. </p> -->
	<p> Designing programmable privacy logic
	  frameworks that correspond to social, ethical, and legal
	  norms has been a fundamentally hard problem. Contextual
	  integrity (CI) (Nissenbaum, 2010) offers a model for
	  conceptualizing privacy that is able to bridge technical
	  design with ethical, legal, and policy approaches. While CI
	  is capable of capturing the various components of contextual
	  privacy in theory, it is challenging to discover and
	  formally express these norms in operational terms.</p>

	<p><b><a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/7/e1501215">Dengue Outbreak Prediction</a></b></p>
	<p> Thousands of lives are lost every year in developing
	  countries for failing to detect epidemics early because of
	  the lack of real-time disease surveillance data. In this
	  project, we use data from a large-scale deployment of a
	  telephone triage service as a basis for dengue forecasting
	  in Pakistan. Our system uses statistical analysis of
	  dengue-related phone calls to accurately forecast suspected
	  dengue cases 2 to 3 weeks ahead of time at a sub-city
	  level. The system has been operational at scale in Pakistan
	  for the past 3 years and has received more than 300,000
	  phone calls. The predictions from the system are widely
	  disseminated to public health officials and form a critical
	  part of active government strategies for dengue
	  containment. This work is the first to demonstrate, with
	  significant empirical evidence, that an accurate,
	  location-specific disease forecasting system can be built
	  using analysis of call volume data from a public health
	  hotline. </p>

        <p><b><a href="http://nyunetworks.com/Pubs/paper-ci2016.pdf">Crowdsourced Learning</a></b></p>
        <p> The conventional education ecosystem in developing regions
	  is plagued by the lack of good quality textbooks and
	  educational resources, lack of skilled teachers and high
	  variability across student skill and motivational
	  levels. This paper makes the case for establishing a
	  crowdsourced learning ecosystem that leverages the
	  collective intelligence of educators around the world to
	  design a collaborative platform [Arias et al. 2000] to
	  easily share, search, organize, rate and present educational
	  materials for teachers and students around the world. In
	  particular, we make two important contributions: (a)
	  Modeling learning outcomes in crowdsourced learning: We
	  propose a mathematical framework that enables systematic
	  modeling and comparison amongst different education
	  paradigms. Our framework provides a means to quantify
	  student learning under a given paradigm based on critical
	  factors such as the student skill (or ability), quality of
	  the reading material (or the teacher), etc. (b) Crowdsourced
	  Learning Platform: We describe the design of YeSua, an
	  initial prototype of our crowdsourced learning platform that
	  uses an inquiry-based framework for generating annotated
	  lesson plans for different subjects. </p>

	<p> Type-1 Diabetes is a chronic illness affecting an
